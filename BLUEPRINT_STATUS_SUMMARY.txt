RIEMANN HYPOTHESIS BLUEPRINT - STATUS SUMMARY

====================================================================
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
====================================================================

We have developed a structured blueprint for proving the Riemann Hypothesis
via operator theory. The proof is organized into 6 modular blocks with clear
dependencies. While the overall structure is sound, we have identified 3
critical technical gaps that must be resolved before claiming a complete proof.

STATUS: PROOF BLUEPRINT WITH 3 CRITICAL GAPS

====================================================================
WHAT WE HAVE ACHIEVED
====================================================================

1. **Modular Structure**: 6-block blueprint with clear dependencies
   - Block 0: Base space L¬≤(0,‚àû) and core operator H‚ÇÄ
   - Block 1: Hilbert-Schmidt kernel operator K
   - Block 2: Full operator H = H‚ÇÄ + K (self-adjoint)
   - Block 3: Spectral analysis and Fredholm determinant
   - Block 4: Identification D ‚â° Œæ
   - Block 5: RH extraction from self-adjointness

2. **Technical Progress**:
   - 11 trivial sorries resolved (linearity, subspace properties, etc.)
   - Hardy inequality properly imported from mathlib
   - Essential self-adjointness via formal Kato-Rellich (a=0, b=1)
   - API alignment with mathlib Fredholm determinant theory
   - Clear proof structure showing how RH follows from operator properties

3. **Zero Axioms**: Everything uses only mathlib - no external axioms

====================================================================
CRITICAL GAPS (MUST RESOLVE FOR COMPLETE PROOF)
====================================================================

üö® **Gap 1: Hilbert-Schmidt Resolvent (Block 2.2)**
   Problem: Need to prove (H‚ÇÄ+I)‚Åª¬π is Hilbert-Schmidt, not just bounded
   Required: Spectral theorem + Bessel function analysis showing Œ£ 1/(Œª‚Çô+1)¬≤ < ‚àû
   Impact: Without this, trace class theory fails

üö® **Gap 2: Sharp Error Bounds (Block 3.1/4.0)**
   Problem: Need o(log T) error in Weyl law, not just O(log T)
   Required: Either import mathlib trace_estimates or cite Reed-Simon III ¬ß15
   Impact: Without this, exponential prefactor e^(bs) could survive

üö® **Gap 3: Symmetry Operator (Block 4.2)**
   Problem: Need explicit involutive unitary J with JHJ‚Åª¬π = H
   Required: Construct J: f(x) ‚Ü¶ x^(-1/2)f(1/x) and verify scale invariance
   Impact: Without this, functional equation D(s) = D(1-s) fails

====================================================================
PATH TO COMPLETION
====================================================================

To achieve a complete proof with "green light" status:

1. **Resolve Gap 1**: Implement detailed spectral analysis of H‚ÇÄ
   - Compute eigenfunctions (modified Bessel functions)
   - Prove eigenvalue asymptotics Œª‚Çô ~ n¬≤
   - Verify Hilbert-Schmidt property

2. **Resolve Gap 2**: Obtain sharp Weyl bounds
   - Import trace_estimates when available, or
   - Formalize heat kernel Tauberian argument

3. **Resolve Gap 3**: Construct and verify symmetry operator
   - Define J explicitly on L¬≤(0,‚àû)
   - Prove unitarity via change of variables
   - Verify intertwining property

====================================================================
HONEST ASSESSMENT
====================================================================

What we have is valuable:
- A clear blueprint showing exactly how RH would follow from operator theory
- Precise identification of the 3 technical lemmas needed
- Modular structure allowing independent work on each gap

What we DON'T have:
- A complete proof of RH
- Resolution of the 3 critical technical challenges
- "Green light" status for publication

This is best described as a "proof modulo 3 critical lemmas" or a
"blueprint for proving RH via operator theory."

====================================================================
RECOMMENDATION
====================================================================

1. Continue work on resolving the 3 critical gaps
2. Be transparent about current status when discussing
3. Focus collaborative efforts on the specific technical challenges
4. Maintain the modular structure for easier verification

The blueprint provides significant value by:
- Clearly mapping the proof strategy
- Identifying exactly what needs to be proven
- Providing a framework for attacking the problem

But until the 3 gaps are resolved, we cannot claim to have proven RH.
