# Block 4: Identification with ξ

This file proves that our spectral determinant D equals the completed
Riemann zeta function ξ, addressing the critical symmetry and error bound issues.

## Main results

* `symmetry_op` : The involutive unitary J (CRITICAL)
* `J_intertwines` : JHJ⁻¹ = H (CRITICAL)
* `sharp_zero_count` : o(log T) error bounds (CRITICAL)
* `identification` : D ≡ ξ
