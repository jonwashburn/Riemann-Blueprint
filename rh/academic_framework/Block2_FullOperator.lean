# Block 2: Full Operator

This file defines H = H₀ + K and proves it is self-adjoint. We also establish
that the resolvent difference is trace class.

## Main definitions

* `H` : The full operator H₀ + K

## Main results

* `sa_H` : H is self-adjoint
* `resolvent_HS` : (H₀ + I)⁻¹ is Hilbert-Schmidt (CRITICAL)
* `resolvent_TC` : (H+i)⁻¹ - (H₀+i)⁻¹ is trace class

/-- 🚨 CRITICAL: (H₀ + I)⁻¹ is Hilbert-Schmidt -/
theorem resolvent_HS : IsHilbertSchmidt ((H₀ + I)⁻¹) := by
  -- CRITICAL BLOCKING ITEM: Use spectral theorem + Bessel function expansion
  -- For H₀ = -d²/dx² - 1/(4x²), the eigenvalues are λₙ ~ n² (asymptotically)
  -- The resolvent (H₀ + I)⁻¹ has eigenvalues 1/(λₙ + 1) ~ 1/n²
  -- Since Σ 1/n² < ∞, the resolvent is Hilbert-Schmidt
  
  -- This requires detailed spectral analysis of the operator -d²/dx² - 1/(4x²)
  -- on L²(0,∞) with appropriate boundary conditions
  -- The proof involves:
  -- 1. Explicit computation of eigenfunctions (modified Bessel functions)
  -- 2. Asymptotic analysis of eigenvalue growth λₙ ~ n²
  -- 3. Verification that Σ 1/(λₙ + 1)² < ∞
  
  -- The eigenfunctions are ψₙ(x) = √(2/π) K₀(√λₙ x) where K₀ is modified Bessel
  -- The eigenvalue equation is: λₙ = (n + 1/2)² for n ∈ ℕ
  -- Therefore: Σ ‖(H₀ + I)⁻¹‖²_HS = Σ 1/(λₙ + 1)² = Σ 1/((n + 1/2)² + 1)² < ∞
  sorry -- CRITICAL: Must implement via spectral theorem + Bessel functions

  -- (H+i)⁻¹ - (H₀+i)⁻¹ = -(H+i)⁻¹ K (H₀+i)⁻¹
